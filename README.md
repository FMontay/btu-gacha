### **BTU Gacha (BlackTower Universe Gacha)**

BTU Gacha is a private Discord gacha bot where the user can "pull" (gamble) for collectible arts of my boyfriend's story characters. This is solely for entertainment and learning purposes, with no intention of marketing whatsoever. 

With BTU Gacha, you can:
- pull for characters (limited to 5 per day)
- check your collection of characters with an integrated binder
- get information on the character cards you obtained
- trade your cards with other users
- use items to get additional pulls & other features

#### Commands:

**!help** -> lists out all the available commands

**!pull** -> Pulls a character at random. Limited to 5 per day (except for free adfitional pulls).

**!binder** -> Opens up the binder/collection list of the collected characters.

**!info <ID_Card>** -> Get more information on character cards (ID obtainable after checking in binder).

**!inventory** -> Opens up inventory to check on items.

**!use <item_name>** -> Use X item from the inventory.


#### Available items:

- **pity-pull** -> Additional pull obtained after 10 duplicates. Can be used after reaching daily limit. Higher chance of getting higher rarity cards, based on the duplicates' rarity.

Example: "John obtained 11 duplicates of a D Tier character. 10 of those cards may be turned into a pity-pull, which guarantees John much higher chances of pulling for a C Tier & higher character, while the chances of pulling for a D Tier & lower are much lower."


#### Rarities:

**E, D, C, B, A, S, SS, ???, ???** [The last two ranks are the rarest, but also secret.]

E having the most common/weakest characters, and SS having rarer/stronger characters. "???" are different. You'll see, if you're lucky enough haha

The higher rarities may contain alternative arts of lower rarities.


#### Future additional gimics:

- Knowledge quiz on the books and the characters
